# Brain-Fog-Bachelor

Before opening the BachelorProject.uproject file, you need to have Microsoft Visual Studio installed.
Open the Visual Studio Installer, and click "Modify" on your installed version.
Make sure you have the "Game development with c++" workload checked, 
with the optional Unreal Engine components checked on the right pane.

Then, right click the uproject file, and select "Generate Visual Studio project files".
Open the newly generated BachelorProject.sln with Visual Studio, and once it's loaded in,
right click the solution at the top of the solution explorer. Select "Build solution".

Wait until the output below states success or failure. (This part might take a while.)
If the build succeeds, you can proceed to open the uproject file.
(And if it fails, us programmers will probably need to fix something.)
